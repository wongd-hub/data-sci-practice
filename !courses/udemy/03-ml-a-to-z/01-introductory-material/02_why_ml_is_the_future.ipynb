    "* Data is everywhere, you leave a 'data exhaust' wherever you go.\n",
    "* From the beginning of time to 2005, humans had created 130 exabytes of data.\n",
    "    * 1,000 letters fits onto about one page which is about a kilobyte.\n",
    "    * 1,000 pages gives you a book, which is about a megabyte.\n",
    "    * Another 1,000 times gives you a gigabyte, which can fit the whole human genome.\n",
    "    * !,000 times that is a terabyte, which you can store about 80 years of HD camera footage in.\n",
    "    * Multiply by another 1,000 and you'll get a petabyte; you can take the entire Amazon rainforest (all 700 billion trees in it), turn those into pages, and fill those pages with text and you'll get 1-2 petabytes worth of data.\n",
    "    * Multiply by another 1,000 and you'll get an exabyte.\n",
    "* By 2010, there were 1,200 exabytes of data.\n",
    "    * By 2015, 7,900 exabytes.\n",
    "    * By 2020, 40,900 exabytes.\n",
    "    * This is a growth of 50x from 2010 to 2020.\n",
    "* Data scientists and machines in their normal course of business use a small percentage of this data, but machine learning presents an opportunity to make sense of the rest of it and use it to add value.\n",

    "# Some other notes about this course\n",

    "* Practical activities will be available in both Python and R, however it's not necessary to do it in both."
