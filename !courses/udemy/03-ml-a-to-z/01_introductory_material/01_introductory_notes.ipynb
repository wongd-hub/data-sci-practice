    "# Introductory notes\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes come from the following course provided on Udemy and taught by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves: [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine learning applications\n",
    "\n",
    "* Facebook - facial recognition; automatically recognises faces and tags people automatically\n",
    "* Xbox - Kinect uses a random forest to track your body movements and convert them into game inputs\n",
    "* VR headsets - ML algorithms monitor your actions and connect them to the game\n",
    "* iPhone - speech to text/voice recognition\n",
    "* Robot dogs - use reinforcement learning to teach the dogs how to walk on their own\n",
    "* Ads - recommender systems\n",
    "* Medicine - machine learning to help save/improve lives\n",
    "* Space - recognising certain areas of the world through maps, as well as explore new territories\n",
    "\n",
    "## ML vs. DL vs. AI - What's the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Source](https://dropbox.com/s/biqmldsnmtp8g8s/OU2-Difference-Between-ML-DL-AI.pdf?dl=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "* Science empowering computers to mimic human intelligence such as in decision making, text processing, and visual perception. This is a broad field, of which Machine Learning and Deep Learning are subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subfield of AI that enables machines to imrpove at a given task with experience.\n",
    "* Subfields of ML include supervised learning (training algorithms on labelled data - classification and clustering), unsupervised learning (training on unlabelled data - clustering), and reinforcement learning (algorithms that take actions to maximise a cumulative reward).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* A subfield of ML that relies on the training of Deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which process information with a model inspired by how the human brain works.\n",
    "* The human brain consists of neurons that communicate with each other, whereas an ANN consists of artificial neurons in a multi-layered mathematical model.\n",
    "* The differentiation here is an ANN's ability to extract features automatically.\n",
    "    1. Machine learning process:\n",
    "        1. Select model to train\n",
    "        2. Manually perform feature extraction\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. Deep learning process:\n",
    "        1. Select architecture of network\n",
    "        2. Features are automatically extracted by feeding in the training data along with the target class\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Regression types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicting a dependent variable, y, using a single independent variable, x.\n",
    "* Assumes a linear relationship between x and y.\n",
    "* Aims to optimise the following relationship: $y = b + mx$\n",
    "    * Sidenote, [good MathJax (Jupyter Notebook math renderer) here](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extends simple linear regression to > 1 independent variables: $y = b_0 + m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \\dots + m_nx_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Models the relationship between y and independent variable x as an $n^{th}$ degree polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $y = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \\dots + b_nx^n$"
