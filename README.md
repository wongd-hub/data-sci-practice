# Data Science Practice Repository

This is a repository I'm using to store my data science (including Kaggle) analyses which I'm doing to practice my data science skills and to learn more about and practice machine learning.

- [**Kaggle - Spaceship Titanic**](./spaceship-titanic): Building a binary classifier (random forest & XGBoost) to determine whether someone will be inadvertently teleported to an alternate dimension.
- [**Kaggle - Favorita Sales**](./favorita-sales): Forecasting the sales volumes of thousands of items at Favorita stores in Ecuador using time series analysis.
