# Kaggle Analyses - Darren Wong

This is a repository I'm using to store my Kaggle Analyses which I'm doing to practice and to learn more about machine learning.

- [**Spaceship Titanic**](./spaceship-titanic): Building a binary classifier (random forest & XGBoost) to determine whether someone will be inadvertently teleported to an alternate dimension.
- [**Favorita Sales**](./favorita-sales): Forecasting the sales volumes of thousands of items at Favorita stores in Ecuador using time series analysis.
